# home-automation-model

Embedded computer system architecture and programming project.
Project to bring a model up to date, whether in aesthetics or in the program. 
It's model of a house with 6 rooms (Bathroom, bedroom, Garage, Kitchen, Living room and Sauna).
On a Raspberry Pi card, we coded in Python to be able to manage at the same time a graphical interface showing all the parameters of the house.

Some sensors no longer work, we still programmed them in case they are changed

To launch the program, simply run in cmd
```bash
python -m src
```
